+ Known Defects & Technical Debt
    - 'Add button' gif form will be pushed to the bottom of page in certain circumstances (responsiveness)
    - background image repeats noticeably
    - bootstrap grid not used explicitly, aligning all retrieved images to the leftmost column (FIXED: 7/27/18)
    - unused variables in code
    - code could benefit from template strings for things like building the API call
